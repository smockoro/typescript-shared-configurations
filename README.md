# typescript-shared-cnfigurations

## Motivation

When you create a typescript project each time, you need to configure the following settings.

- TypeScript compilation settings
- Lint settings for ESLint
- TypeDoc settings
- Prettier configuration

This is almost the same for all projects, so we want to use a common definition.

## Positioning of this repository

This repository serves three purposes

- Compilation of each common definition
  Leading to the repository of each definition from this repository.
- Common Issue management
  It is complicated to create issues in each repository, so this is the place to manage them.
- Common documentation
  Documentation of the configuration values is kept in this repository.

## Link to each common definition

- [tsconfig](https://github.com/smockoro/tsconfig)
- [eslint](https://github.com/smockoro/eslint-config)
- [typedoc](https://github.com/smockoro/typedoc-config)
